### MTF Panes

[Multi Timeframe Panes package](https://www.tradingview.com/market/lb-mtfpanes/)  contains 5 indicators that show information from four user-configurable timeframes in a single pane, allowing you to assess the market state quickly and correctly. These MTF panes include often-used indicators - RSI, Williams %R, Moving Averages and Squeeze - making them indispensable for either long term play or for scalping.

For squeeze, both COG squeeze and BB/KC squeeze panes are included. The ability to mark the price bars with squeeze on all timeframes (user selectable) makes trading break-outs and options easy and more rewarding.

### S/R Levels

[Support/Resistance Levels package](https://www.tradingview.com/market/lb-srlevels/)  includes 7 indicators. These automatically derive S/R price areas from the underlying indicators and show them overlaid on price. These include S/R Levels derived from indicators like RSI, CCI, %B and Williams %R.

By visually laying out S/R Levels on chart, these allow complex S/R clusters to be identified and used correctly. Ability to overlay a custom timeframe S/R Levels with the current levels clearly highlights price turning points, and allows easy determination of take-profit/target levels.
