### JURIK_RESEARCH

[Jurik Research](https://www.tradingview.com/market/ju-jurikstudies/)  has gained the reputation of the most reliable, precise and smooth indicators. Ideally, you would like a filtered signal to be both smooth and lag-free. Lag causes delays in your trades, and increasing lag in your indicators typically result in lower profits.

### JMA

Investors, banks and institutions worldwide ask for the Jurik Research Moving Average (JMA). You may apply it just as you would any other popular moving average. However, JMA's improved timing and smoothness will astound you.

### RSX

The popular RSI indicator simultaneously measures trend velocity and quality. RSI gives a strong signal when a trend is fast and clean. However, RSI is a jittery signal, making technical analysis very difficult. Jurik's RSX is vastly superior. The chart compares the classic RSI to Jurik's RSX.

### VEL

The classical momentum indicator is a simple yet effective measure of market direction. Typical attempts to remove noise by applying a moving average will seriously degrade its usefulness by adding lag. Jurik Research solved this problem with an advanced momentum oscillator that produces very smooth curves.

### CFB

Serious analysts are now adjusting the speed of their indicators to the duration of market trend. If this idea appeals to you, you need a tool that measures price trend duration, not cycle length. Jurik Research discovered, back in 1996, how fractals could readily assess the duration of market trend. The new indicator, called CFB (Composite Fractal Behavior), works well whether or not the price time series has any cycle components.

### DMX

DMX is the ultra-smooth, low lag version of your classic DMI indicator. With DMX on your charts, you can throw away both DMI and ADX. The classic indicator ADX is a smoothed (and lagging) version of the more basic, and more noisy, DMI indicator. DMI itself is composed of two jittery components, DMI.up and DMI.down, combined the following way: DMI=| DMI.up - DMI.down | / | DMI.up + DMI.down |
