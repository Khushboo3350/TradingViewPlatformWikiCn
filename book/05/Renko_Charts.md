# DEFINITION

Renko charts are a chart type that only measures price movement. The word renko is derived from the Japanese word “renga” which means “bricks”. Not so coincidentally, renko charts are constructed from a series of bricks whose creation is determined by fluctuations in price. The concept of renko bars is very straightforward. First, the size of the bricks is pre-determined by the user. Once price moves more than the user defined “brick size” either above or below the most recent brick, a new brick is added to the chart.

It is important to note that new bricks are only added when price movements completely “fill” the predetermined “brick size”. Prices may exceed the values of the previous brick (either above or below), however a new brick will not be formed until the price movement is large enough. For example, let’s say the brick size is set to 2 points and the last brick covers prices of $52 to $54. The new brick won’t be formed until prices close either at or above $56 or at or below $50. If price closes above $56, for example $57; the new brick must still stop at $56.

**There are two rules regarding brick placement:**

1.  Bricks will always have their corners touching.
2.  There can never be more than one brick in any one vertical column.

# BRICK TYPES

**There are four different types of bricks generated by a tradingview.com renko chart.**

1.  **Up Bricks**  – Bricks that forms above the previous brick.
2.  **Down Bricks**  – Bricks that form below the previous brick
3.  **Projection Up Bricks**  – During an intraday timeframe, a potential up brick that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).
4.  **Projection Down Bricks**  – During an intraday timeframe, a potential down brick that would form based on current price (before actual closing price is set).

# BRICK CALCULATION METHODS

There are two different method for bricks to be calculated:
1.	Average True Range (ATR) – Uses the values generated by the Average True Range (ATR) indicator. The ATR is used to filter out the normal noise or 
        volatility of a financial instrument. The ATR method “automatically” determines a good brick size. 
        It calculates what the ATR value would be in a regular candlestick chart and then makes this value the brick size.

2.	Traditional – Uses a user-pre-defined absolute value for brick size. New bricks are only created when price movement 
        is at least as large as the pre-determined brick size. The upside to this method is that it is very straightforward and 
        it is easy to anticipate when and where new bricks will form. The downside is that selecting the correct brick size for 
        a specific instrument will take some experimentation. Typically, you will want to select a brick size that is 
        about 1/20th of the current value of the instrument.
