# Extended Trading Hours

# APPLICATION

TradingView now allows Pro+ and Premium users the ability to chart extended trading hours. Extended trading hours consists of any trading done either before or after the traditional day session trading hours of 9:30am to 4:00pm EST. Because of the emergence of Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs), individual investors now have the ability to trade during the pre-market and after-hours trading sessions. Previously, these options were generally only available to institutional or high net-worth investors.

PLEASE NOTE: Pro+ subscriptions only use BATS charts which do not work with this extended hours feature. You must pay additional fees for real-time market data in each market, then you will have access to extended hour data in the charts.

**Pre-Market trading hours are from 4:00am to 9:30am EST**

**After-Hours trading hours are from 4:00pm to 8:00pm EST**

It is important to note that extended trading hours have much less volume and liquidity than the traditional day session. In TradingView, only the portions of the extended hours sessions which have trading activity to chart are shown. If there is no trading activity during a timeframe, then that timeframe will not be charted.

  
**In the chart below, the standard day session and the extended hours sessions have been separated by color. The day sessions have a blue background while extended hours sessions have a yellow background.**
