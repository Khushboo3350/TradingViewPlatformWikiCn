# Study Templates

# APPLICATION

Study templates are a very useful feature of tradingview charts. Essentially they are a way of grouping several studies or indicators together into a single package. That package can then be applied to any chart. Tradingview comes with 6 study templates pre enabled. The six standard study templates are; Bill Williams' 3 Lines, Displaced EMA, MA Exp Ribbon, Oscillators, Swing Trading and Volume Based. Users can then also create their own and save them to their own database.

**This is an example of a CORN chart utilizing the Oscillator Study Template. The Oscillator Study Template employs Basic Volume plus three oscillating indicators; The  [Stochastic RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Stochastic_RSI_(STOCH_RSI) "Stochastic RSI (STOCH RSI)"),  [RSI](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Relative_Strength_Index_(RSI) "Relative Strength Index (RSI)")  and  [CCI](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Commodity_Channel_Index_(CCI) "Commodity Channel Index (CCI)").**
