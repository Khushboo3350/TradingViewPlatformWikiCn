# APPLICATION

Fib Time Zone is a  [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis")  tool consisting of a series of vertical lines which extend along the x (horizontal) axis. These lines are placed according to the Fibonacci sequence. The main function of the Fibonacci Time Zone tool is to forecast or anticipate potential  [reversals](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend#Reversal "Market Trend")  based on elapsed time.

The first few Fibonacci numbers create relatively tight Fibonacci Time Zones at the beginning of the chart. Because of this it may be necessary to ignore the first few zones. After the first few zones, the zones expand quickly and allows some breathing room as the sequence unfolds. The basic theory behind Fib Time Zones is that potential reversal points can be found by looking ahead to the starting point of new zones.

Fibonacci Time Zone parameters are defined by the Fibonacci Sequence. Starting with 0 and 1, each number is the sum of the two prior numbers (1+2=3, 2+3=5, 5+8=13 8+13=21 etc…).
