# APPLICATION

Fibonacci Circles are another indicator based on the Fibonacci Sequence used in  [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis"). They are created by first drawing a  [trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")  between two extreme points. Circles are drawn at 11 different levels including the key Fibonacci Ratios of 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8% and 100%.

It is important to note, that "typical" levels are used by default. The user has the ability to format the tool to show/hide specific levels as well as manually change level values and save those changes as templates.

**Some of the circles might not be visible, because of the scale limitations of the chart window.**

Fibonacci Circles can indicate  [support and resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Support_and_Resistance "Support and Resistance")  levels. Usually when the price remains above the higher circle, and if the higher circle is then penetrated, prices generally fall to the lower circle, which in many cases, becomes the support level. If prices break below the higher circle, fall to the lower circle, and then begin to rise, the lower circle becomes the support level. Also this works vice versa for resistance but in the opposite direction.
