# APPLICATION

Speed Resistance Fans are tools used  [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis")  to identify  [support and resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Support_and_Resistance "Support and Resistance")  levels of a trend and the price level a  [trend](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend "Market Trend")  correction may rise or fall. A Speed Resistance Fan consists of a trend line on which speed resistance lines are drawn above (which represent time) and below (which represent price). These lines are drawn based on time/price percentages of the distance between the beginning and end of the trend line. The most common speed line percentages used by analysts are one-third and two-thirds. Fibonacci Ratios are frequently used.

Speed lines are a combination of  [trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")  and percentage retracement analysis. Speed resistance lines not only help to measure trend corrections (percentage retracement) but also measure the speed of a trend.

Speed Resistance Fan lines can also be viewed as support or resistance lines. In an  [uptrend](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend#Bullish "Market Trend"), price usually stays above the higher speed line. If this line is penetrated, prices generally fall to the lower speed line, which in many cases becomes the support level. However, if prices break below the higher speed line, fall to the lower speed line, and then begin to rise, the lower speed line becomes the resistance level. In a  [downtrend](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend#Bearish "Market Trend"), the breaking of a lower speedline indicates a possible rise or rally to a higher line. If a breakout occurs above that line, the rally may continue to the top of the prior trend (or the underlying trend line).
