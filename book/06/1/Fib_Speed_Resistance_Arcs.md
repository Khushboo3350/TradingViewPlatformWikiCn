# APPLICATION

Fibonacci Speed Resistance Arcs are used in  [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis")  to determine the direction and speed of the trend  [reversals](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend#Reversal "Market Trend")  and also indicate the support/resistance levels. The first step is drawing a  [trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")  between two extreme points (for example a peak and a valley). Then arcs are created and intersect the trend/speed line at the selected distance percentages between the beginning and the end of this trend line. Typical Fibonacci percentage ratios are used however TradingView allows users to manually select whichever percentages they wish to use (up to 11 of them).

-   Need visual

**Some of the arcs might not be visible, because of the scale limitations of the chart window.**

The Fibonacci Speed/Resistance Arcs can indicate  [support and resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Support_and_Resistance "Support and Resistance")  levels. Usually the price remains above the higher arc. If the higher arc is penetrated, prices generally fall to the lower arc, which in many cases, becomes the support level. If prices break below the higher arc, fall to the lower arc, and then begin to rise, the lower arc becomes the resistance level.
