# APPLICATION

Fibonacci Trend-Based Time Lines is an analytical drawing tool used to predict the future price movements and examine the  [support and resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Support_and_Resistance "Support and Resistance")  levels as well as price breakouts. It is represented by a series of vertical lines at date/time levels that shows probable price corrections in an existing  [trend](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend "Market Trend"). First, a  [trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")  is drawn. Depending on its length and direction, vertical lines are drawn based on the selected distance percentages or on the Fibonacci percentages.

Support indicates a low or series of troughs where price activity has not penetrated. Resistance indicates a high or series of peaks where price activity has not penetrated.
