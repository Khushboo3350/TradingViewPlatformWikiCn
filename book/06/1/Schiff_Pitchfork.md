# APPLICATION

The Schiff Pitchfork is a drawing tool used in  [technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis")  that is derived from the standard  [pitchfork](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Pitchfork "Pitchfork"). There are three basic components of a standard pitchfork. There is a center median line ([trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")) as well as two more sets of lines above and below that median line. The additional lines are set a specified number of  [standard deviations](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Standard_Deviation "Standard Deviation")  away from the median. Where the Schiff Pitchfork differs is that its origin's location is modified from a standard pitchfork. The Schiff Pitchfork's origin is located at 1/2 the vertical distance and 1/2 the horizontal distance between the high and low points (first two points set).

A Schiff pitchfork (just like a standard pitchfork) is created by first drawing a trend line between two extreme points. A third point is then set either above or below the second point depending on the analyst's desired Schiff Pitchfork location. Keep in mind that the default Schiff Pitchfork setting calls for two additional sets of lines to be drawn. Tradingview allows for up to 9 sets of lines to be added. If additional lines are added, the user can save this setup as a template for later use.

The basic idea behind the use of a Schiff Pitchfork and a standard pitchfork is that it essentially creates a type of trend channel. A trend is considered active as long as price stays within the Schiff Pitchfork channel.  [Reversals](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend#Reversal "Market Trend")  occur when price breaks out of a Schiff Pitchfork channel.
