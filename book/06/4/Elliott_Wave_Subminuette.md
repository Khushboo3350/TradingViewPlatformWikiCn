TradingView does offer an  [Elliott Wave](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/static/index.php?title=Elliott_Wave&action=edit&redlink=1 "Elliott Wave (page does not exist)")  indicator which will automatically overlay Elliot Waves and their associated points onto a chart. However, as with any indicator, coordinates may need to be adjusted.  [Technical analysis](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Technical_Analysis "Technical Analysis")  is obviously not an exact science. Therefore, analysts need to be able to adapt and make changes to their analysis on the fly. Some traders may decide that manually drawing Elliot Waves is the better option for their trading style.

Elliot Waves, in their most basic and straightforward form, consist of 8 points. The first 5 points are marked by numbers and create what are known as impulse waves. These are waves that move along with the  [trend](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Market_Trend "Market Trend"). The last 3 points are marked with letters and create what are known as corrective waves. These are waves that retrace back against the trend.

Elliot Waves are classified by their Degrees. Degrees are determined by the duration of the trend and therefore the length of the wave pattern. In every degree category, impulse wave points are designated by numbers, while corrective wave points are designated by letters.

  
**From largest to smallest, Degrees are typically classified and designated as:**

-   GrandSuper Circle - ((I)) ((II)) ((III)) ((IV)) ((V)) ((a)) ((b)) ((c))
-   SuperCircle - (I) (II) (III) (IV) (V) (a) (b) (c)
-   Circle - I II III IV V a b c
-   Major - ((1)) ((2)) ((3)) ((4)) ((5)) ((A)) ((B)) ((C))
-   Intermediate - (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (A) (B) (C)
-   Minor - 1 2 3 4 5 A B C
-   Minute - ((i)) ((ii)) ((iii)) ((iv)) ((v)) ((a)) ((b)) ((c))
-   Minuette - (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) (a) (b) (c)
-   Subminuette - i ii iii iv v a b c
