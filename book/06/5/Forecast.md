# APPLICATION

Forecast is a highly useful drawing tool, especially when used in the context of sharing trade ideas with the rest of the TradingView community. Forecast allows the user to place an entry and an exit price for a trade. However, it also allows the user to define the trade's duration by extending the forecast line. As time progresses (and prices change), the forecast will automatically be deemed a "success" or a "failure".
