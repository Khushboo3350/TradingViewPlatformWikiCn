# APPLICATION

The extended line drawing tool allows you to place a line on your chart which extends indefinitely in any direction. This could be used to create your own  [trend line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Trend_Line "Trend Line")  or trend channel. The key feature is that it extends indefinitely. What this means, is that no matter how far into the future or past you move the chart, the line will still be visible, extending at the same angle as its origin.

### Line

Can change the color of the extended line as well as its thickness and line style.

### Text

If an option such as "Show Price Range", "Bars Range", "Date/Time Range" or "Distance" is enabled, this will allow you to change the text color, font type and font size. You can also choose to bold and/or italicize the text.

### Left End

Can choose between having a "normal" end with no arrow on it and having an arrow attached to that specific end. Can also choose to "Extend" the extended line or not. If a line is extended, it will continue on the same path indefinitely, even when out of the current view of the chart.
