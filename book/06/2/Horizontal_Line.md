# APPLICATION

Horizontal lines are often used to make note of a specific price. They can also be very useful when marking off levels of  [support and or resistance](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Support_and_Resistance "Support and Resistance"). Much like  [extended lines](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Extended_Line "Extended Line"), horizontal lines continue on in their respective direction indefinitely.
