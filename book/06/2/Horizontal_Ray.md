# APPLICATION

The Horizontal Ray drawing tool is similar to the  [horizontal line](https://www.tradingview.com/wiki/Horizontal_Line "Horizontal Line")  except that it only extends in one direction. The user places the origin of the ray at their discretion and the ray continues in the desired direction indefinitely.
